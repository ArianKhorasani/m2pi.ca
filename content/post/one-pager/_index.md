## About
<em>Math<sup>Industry</sup></em> (Math to power industry) is a professional development
school for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the mathematical
sciences. The students in <em>Math<sup>Industry</sup></em> already have extremely
valuable technical skills. At <em>Math<sup>Industry</sup></em>, we equip them with the
professional skills they need to excel in non-academic environments. Teams of
students are matched with industry partners to exercise their skills using
tried-and-true work integrated learning techniques which have worked for more
than 20 years. So, while students learn how to be a better job candidate, our
industry partners have the opportunity to experience the benefits of utilizing
mathematical science in decision making, product development and other aspects
of their business.

## Canada Benefits 
Canadian universities train thousands of graduate students in the mathematical
sciences each year. These students are a national resource that must not be
underutilized. Ideas from the mathematical sciences are vital to Canada's
industry sectors. Predictive models, data analysis,optimization, computation and
other mathematical insights can be used in making business decisions accurately
and effectively.

At <em>Math<sup>Industry</sup></em>, we have developed a cohort-based job training and
placement program to help ensure that highly skilled personnel will be ready and
able to advance Canada’s economy. Studies by Deloitte have demonstrated the
enormous impact that the mathematical sciences have on the UK and Dutch
economies. For Canada, this is more important now than ever. The economic
ramifications of the pandemic are likely to significantly reduce opportunities
in academic career pathways for a generation of young researchers. Our goal is
to redirect the talent pool towards activities that will drive Canada’s economic
recovery.

## The Win-Win-Win of <em>Math<sup>Industry</sup></em>
Math^Industry provides an enriched opportunity for students, industry partners,
and academic mentors alike. Check out the industry problems that were submitted
and the solutions our participants obtained in 2020.

## The Program
The <em>Math<sup>Industry</sup></em> program is offered each summer over the course of 4
weeks. The program combines a two-week training bootcamp in programming and
business skills with a two-week intensive team-based project. Interdisciplinary
teams, anchored with academic and industrial mentors, will be convened to focus
on industrial problems. Teams are supported with resources to facilitate
effective collaboration. The bootcamp and team project together give students
the experience of integrating classroom learning with work experience, making
graduates of our program uniquely qualified. The <em>Math<sup>Industry</sup></em> program
builds on more than 20 year of PIMS experience offering other industrial
training opportunities, such as Industrial Problem Solving Workshops
([IPSW](https://www.pims.math.ca/industrial/industrial-workshops)):

> The IPSW provides an opportunity for industry professionals to pose
> difficult real-world research problems to highly-qualified graduate students in
> a focused collaborative environment and see quality results in a short period of
> time, while making connections that often lead to valuable recruitment
> opportunities.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;  -- **Matt McDonald, Office of the CTO, Fotech Solutions**

Starting in 2020, our program is convened virtually. This has the benefit of
allowing us to easily recruit students from a broad geographic region, with
preference given to students enrolled in PIMS member universities.
