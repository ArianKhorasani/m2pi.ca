For over twenty-two years Dianeâ€™s work has encompassed multiple areas of
organization development including leadership, governance, planning, policy,
programs, project management, change, evaluation and assessment. As a
consultant, facilitator and coach, she has worked in many sectors, including
healthcare, immigration, education, environment, social services, arts, culture
and sport. Her experience spans nonprofit, government and business organizations
locally, provincially and nationally. 

Diane researches governance in the context of leadership and she studies the
relationship between capacity building, organizational effectiveness and
community impact. Her recent studies have focused on the benefits of
neuroscience knowledge in the areas of learning and leadership. Her passion is
to support people to do the work that will build their skill and confidence to
create and sustain healthy and effective teams, processes, structures and
leadership.

In addition to being an Associate of Clarrus | EM Sciences, Diane is also a
co-owner of VADIS Consulting Group in Saskatoon, a group of consultants driven
to help people strengthen their teams and organizations and create healthy
workplace environments that thrive in a world where change is constant and
complexity is the norm. When not helping people have conversations that matter
she is playing music, creating stained glass, hanging outdoors and around water,
doing yoga and finding joy and laughter with family and friends.
