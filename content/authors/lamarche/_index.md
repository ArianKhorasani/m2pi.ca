Lynne Lamarche thrives in creating experiential learning spaces and authentic
dialogue. Her Organization Development practice of 25 years relies on
participatory approaches where collective intelligence emerges. Her passion for
people practices geared toward progressive solutions combined with her creative
mindset makes her an ideal partner to explore safely unexpected territories. As
in all living systems, individuals and groups thrive on rejuvenating themselves.
With this belief in mind, Lynne’s creativity sparks inspiration, ignites
dialogues and reflections, and unlocks potential to creative problem solving.

She navigates between the role of “content expert” for areas of transformation,
group dynamics, organizational effectiveness, leadership development, learning
and facilitation as well as “holding the space” for the process in both French
and English. Lynne graduated from NTL-Telfer Institute in Organizational
Development, and in Applied Creativity and Innovation from Université de
Montréal, holds an M.B.A. and is an accomplished certified Points of You™
trainer.
