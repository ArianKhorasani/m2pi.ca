Prior to entering the realm of computing, Marie-Helene Burle spent 15 years
roaming the globe from the Arctic to Sub-Antarctic islands or tropical
atolls, conducting bird and mammal research. As a PhD candidate in
behavioural and evolutionary biology at Simon Fraser University, she "fell"
into Emacs, R, and Linux. This turned Marie into an advocate for open
source tools and improved computing literacy for all, as well as better
coding practices and more reproducible workflows in science. She started to
contribute to the open source community, became a Software and Data
Carpentry Instructor, and worked at the SFU Research Commons providing
programming support to researchers. She now teaches research computing
tools at WestGrid. When not behind a computer, Marie loves reading history
books and looking for powder in the British Columbia backcountry on skis.
