I am a teaching and learning fellow in the Master of Data Science program at the
University of British Columbia. I received my PhD in Physics from the Reinsberg
lab in 2019 (also at UBC) where among other things, I developed a new MRI
technique to assess the oxygenation status of tumours using independent
component analysis (ICA). During my PhD I got interested in data science,
learning analytics, and science communication and that led me to learn more
about statistical techniques such as ICA and data visualization using dashboards
and effective plotting.
