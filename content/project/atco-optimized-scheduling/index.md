title: "ATCO - Optimized Scheduling"
summary: "Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 around the world, and government
policies implemented as a response to the outbreak, many corporations have
chosen to let their employees work from home to prevent the spread of the
disease. In order to safely re-open the economy, one of the recommendations from
health authorities is to allow only a limited percentage of workers in the
workplace at any specific time.  Given these constraints, it is useful for
companies to arrange  flexible work schedule so the employees go to offices
during reasonable working hours, and at the same time reduce their commute time
to improve their productivity. In this problem, you will help a model business
to design and optimize their employees’ working-at-office schedule using a
combination of criteria which you deem to be important, and real-life data such
as traffic, limitation on work schedule hours, commuting time and others."

# Optimization of Employee Work Schedule,

### Industry mentors: Vakhtang Putkaradze and Kui Pan
 
Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, and government policies
implemented as a response to the outbreak, many corporations have chosen to let
their employees work from home to prevent the spread of the disease. In order
to safely re-open the economy, one of the recommendations from health
authorities is to allow only a limited percentage of workers in the workplace
at any specific time.  Given these constraints, it is useful for companies to
arrange  flexible work schedule so the employees go to offices during
reasonable working hours, and at the same time reduce their commute time to
improve their productivity. In this problem, you will help a model business to
design and optimize their employees’ working-at-office schedule using a
combination of criteria which you deem to be important, and real-life data such
as traffic, limitation on work schedule hours, commuting time and others.

#### Problem Description
For a company in a given city, the known parameters include: the total number of
employees $N$, the location of the company $S$ , the home address of each
employee $S^i_e (1 \leq i \leq N)$, the maximum percentage of workers allowed at
the office \alpha, the reasonable working hours (a time window, or distribution
of weights indicating less/more desirable), a minimum number of hours for each
employee to work at office per week $T$, and the historical traffic pattern of the
city. For simplicity, you can assume that there are no specific working
sub-groups that have to be present at a given time (e.g., incorporating meeting
schedule).  Since this is an open question, the schedule of employees’ working
at the office can be optimized with respect to different aspects, such as the
commute time between office and home, road safety conditions (presence of
ice/snow), traffic conditions, etc. You will be required to define the parameter
(or parameters) to optimize and use quantitative methods to justify your
conclusions.

#### Data Sources
For this problem, you can choose your favorite city anywhere in the world
(Calgary, Toronto, Seattle, New York, New Delhi, Mexico City...). We advise to
take the model company location to be chosen downtown as it usually has more
associated traffic data. The employee home address $S^i_e$ can be randomly
sampled throughout the city. Some of the known parameters can be set as any 
reasonable values. For example: $N = 200\sim 1000$, $\alpha = 25\\%\sim
35\\%$, $T = 15\sim 25$ hours, and working time window $7\textrm{AM}−
7\textrm{PM}$ (or, alternatively, set your own weights in time desirability
distribution). It is recommended for the participants to find their own datasets
depending on the parameter chosen to be optimized. As an example, to optimize
the commute time of employees some useful datasets are available, such as the
"Uber Movement" [^1] that has provided the historical travel time between two
locations for a given period in each day (see Fig. 1), and the “Calgary Transit
Reliability” [^2].

#### Related Knowledge
There is no prerequisite knowledge strongly needed for this problem, but some
level of knowledge in “Mathematical Optimization” [^3] and “Optimization
Algorithms” [^4] are desired. One may also find the “Stochastic Gradient Descent”
[^5] frequently used in Deep Learning is useful here.

#### Evaluation Metrics
The final submission will be evaluated based on the following key metrics:

1. Clear definition of optimization problem with the corresponding optimization parameter.
1. Use appropriate algorithms, clean explanation of processes leading to the conclusion.
1. Finding and use of reliable data sources, handle missing data correctly, list
   the origin and determine the accuracy of data.
